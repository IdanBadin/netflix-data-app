## 🧠 About the Project

This app was developed by **Idan Badin** as a midterm assignment in the **Introduction to Data Science** course.  
It analyzes a public Netflix dataset using Python tools taught in class:

- 📦 **Pandas** for data cleaning & manipulation  
- 🎨 **Seaborn + Matplotlib** for data visualization  
- 🖥️ **Streamlit** for building an interactive dashboard  

The app demonstrates:
- Content type distribution (Movies vs TV Shows)
- Year-over-year growth in Netflix's catalog
- Rating breakdowns
- Duration comparisons by country
- Trends over time — all filterable by type and year
